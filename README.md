# Particle-swarm-optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization in Java.

Implemented The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in Java with another 2 of its variants:
Inertia Weight and Constriction Factor

Experimental Results were obtained using 3 topologies: FullGraph, Ring and 4Neighbors.
As objective function, 4 different functions were tested: Rosenbrock, Rastrigin, Sphere and Grienwank.
All of the functions minimum is in 0, so the error will also be the value of the closest particle to the minimum.

# Particle-swarm-optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization in Java.

Implemented The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in Java in  3 variants: Base variant, Inertia Weight and Constriction Factor.
Experimental Results were obtained using 3 topologies: FullGraph, Ring and 4Neighbors.
As objective function, 4 different functions were tested: Rosenbrock, Rastrigin, Sphere and Grienwank.
All of the functions minimum is achieved in 0, thereby the error obtained will be the value of the closest particle to this minimum.
